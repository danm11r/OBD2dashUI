# OBD2dashUI
Digital dash board UI built with Python and QtQuick

# About 
This app was built with Python and the PyQt5 toolkit, and uses the Python-OBD library for OBD2 communications. A ELM327 OBD2 adapter is needed for the OBD2 interface. The current version is only a proof of concept, but will display the MPH, RPM, engine temp, and battery voltage. Note that there is currently _no_ error handling for the OBD2 connection - if OBD2 is disconnected while the app is running, it will crash. This will be addressed soon!
